</p>


**Krishi Mitra** is an AI-powered web application for rapid detection of plant leaf diseases from images, with actionable guidance for crop management. It leverages deep learning and a local LLM (large language model) for natural language treatment advice.

---

## Overview

Krishi Mitra streamlines crop disease identification through a simple, menu-driven web interface built with Python and Streamlit. Users can upload a plant leaf image, and the system detects the disease and instantly suggests causes, treatments, and precautions.

The backend uses a pretrained ResNet CNN model for image classification. For each detected disease, the app calls a local LLM via an API to generate advice based on the data provided for treatments and best practices.

## Features

- **AI-powered disease prediction** from plant leaf images
- **Treatment and prevention guidance** generated via local LLM API
- **Comprehensive disease coverage** for crops like apple, corn, grape, tomato, and more
- **Clean and modern interface** with custom logo
- **Extensible dataset** for new crops and diseases

---

## Technologies Used

- Python (TensorFlow, NumPy, PIL)
- Streamlit (web UI)
- Custom API for LLM-based recommendations (`api.py`)
- Dataset of plant diseases and treatments (`data.py`)
- ResNet50 model pretrained for leaf disease classification

---

## File Structure

- `app.py` â€” Main Streamlit app (user interface & ML inference)
- `api.py` â€” Handles requests to local LLM for natural language disease reporting
- `data.py` â€” Store known diseases & treatment recommendations
- `data_formatting.py` â€” Utility functions for formatting and normalization
- `logo.jpg` â€” App logo displayed in UI

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/krishi-mitra.git
cd krishi-mitra


2. **Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt



3. **Set up the local LLM API**  
â€“ The backend needs access to your local LLM server, set by default to `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` in `api.py`.  
â€“ Make sure the model name and endpoint match your LLM installation.

---

## Usage

1. **Launch the app:**
streamlit run app.py


2. **Navigate to the provided local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501)**

3. **Upload a clear leaf image**  
â€“ The app will automatically predict the disease and display:
  - Disease name
  - Causes and biological context
  - Treatments
  - Precautions

4. **Review AI-generated advice** and implement preventive or curative steps on your crops.

(**See `data.py` for the full list and recommended treatments.**)

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- **Add new diseases:**  
â€“ Edit the `diseases` list and `treatments` dictionary within `data.py`.

- **Update model or backend:**  
â€“ Replace ResNet50 or edit `api.py` to connect with any local or hosted LLM.

- **Change logo:**  
â€“ Replace `logo.jpg` in the project folder.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **API errors:**  
Ensure your local LLM server is running and the endpoint/server configuration matches your environment.
- **Image not processed:**  
Double check file type (JPG, PNG) and image clarity. Images must show the full leaf for accurate diagnosis.
- **Model or library issues:**  
Ensure all Python libraries and model weights are correctly installed.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow
- Requests
- PIL
- NumPy
- Local LLM API compatible with prompt and response structure shown in `api.py`
